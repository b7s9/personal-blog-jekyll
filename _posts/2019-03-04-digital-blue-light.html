    <h3 class="visually-hidden">Introduction</h3>
    <p>Cello may have been the first publicly released browser to default to dark text on a light but warmer yellow
        background. I could not find any reading on this (or the browser in general), especially since the browser was
        poorly made/maintained, and not in use for very long. However, the mere mention of this in class, ignited my
        curiosity in how we’ve grown to understand the effects of screen color warmth, what’s been done in response, and
        what could be on the horizon. Hopefully, throughout this essay I can make concepts from existing vision science
        literature more accessible.</p> <!--more-->

    <p>Disclaimer, staring at the sun or a clear blue sky is far worse for your retinas than looking at screens at
        night, however, using blue light screens at night will be worse for your sleep schedule and quality.</p>

    <h3>Definitions</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Color warmth</strong> (on a color wheel) is what we tend to think of as warmth from a design perspective.
        In fig. 1. (https://www.mgxcopy.com/mindshare/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2000px-BYR_color_wheel.svg_.png), colors
        to the left of center are cold, while colors to the right are warm. This design knowledge will be unintuitive in
        the context of this essay, so put this concept aside for now.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Color temperature</strong> (measured in Kelvin) is the measurement of how intense/hot a light source is.
        For instance, the sun/a clear blue sky is the most powerful light source we can measure, clocking in around 15-27
        thousand Kelvin, whereas candle light, which is one of the coolest light sources we can measure, clocks in at a
        much lower 1.7 thousand Kelvin see fig. 2.
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature#Categorizing_different_lighting). This definition is what I will
        be referring to throughout this essay.
    </p>

    <p>
        A person’s <strong>Circadian Rhythm</strong> is essentially their internal clock, which dictates when the body
        should be awake or asleep. This cycle tends to line up with 24 hour day cycles. Staying up very late would be one
        example of interfering with/delaying this cycle. This process is regulated by the body’s production of melatonin. I
        will explore this further.

    <h3>Blue light can be harmful to human health.</h3>
    <p>
        This discovery is only about twenty years old, but since then vision science literature has exploded with research
        on the topic – adding further confirmations to the original concept, further expanding on a variety health
        detriments ranging from obesity to cancer, and comparing different lighting or temporal scenarios. But don’t
        believe me, the creators of f.lux have curated a list of over 50 articles (up until 2016) pertaining to just about
        every angle of the topic (f.lux, 2016).
    </p>

    <p>
        In fig. 3, a light frequency spectrum from fluxometer shows us a breakdown of a high intensity light – what humans
        would perceive as pure white daylight. Notice the subtle grey bell curve around 480nm near the blue area on the
        left of the graph. All light within this bell curve is known colloquially as “blue light”, due to its midpoint
        situated comfortably within the blue frequencies. Note how it actually includes some violet and many of the green
        frequencies as well. This band of light can be harmful because it interferes with the body’s circadian rhythm,
        especially when perceived during non-daylight hours (Morita et al., 1996).
    </p>

    <p>
        Our eyes have photoreceptors called ipRGC’s which specifically target this band of blue light. These ipRGC’s are
        home to the melanopsin photopigment, which is a key mediator in the body’s melatonin production. When we view light
        frequencies within the blue light band, melanopsin will suppress melatonin production, effectually delaying the
        body’s circadian rhythm. Existing literature commonly refers to this result as a circadian phase shift. In layman’s
        terms, if you look at a bright light very late in the evening, your body might want to go to bed an hour later and
        wake up an hour later, shifting your whole sleep schedule back an hour (Berson et al., 2002).
    </p>

    <p>What’s so bad about this?</p>

    <p>One of the most often cited papers in this field reports that using light emitting screens (they studied
        e-readers specifically) before bedtime resulted in people taking longer to fall asleep and experiencing less REM
        sleep (they had poorer quality sleep), leading to the aforementioned circadian phase shift, which caused more
        drowsiness the following morning and longer to fully “wake up” (Chang et al., 2015). A later study, abstracted this
        idea by subjecting people to intermittent bright pulses of light, and had similar findings in terms of effects on
        sleep and alertness (Gronfier et al., 2004).</p>

    <h3>F.lux saves the day.</h3>
    <p>
        In 2009 a computer software application called f.lux was created to reduce the negative effects of using screens at
        night. f.lux mimics the cycle of a 24 hour day, using location based sunrise/sunset times to match the color
        temperature of a screen, to that of the ambient color temperature outside. LCD/computer screens tend to be 50-60%
        as bright as daylight, but to our eyes, this is a close approximation, which is still very hot. The program uses a
        blue light filter to reduce the amount of blue light, to achieve the proper color temperature. Very late at night
        (while we should be asleep!) f.lux will lower the color temperature to roughly 2% of natural daylight. This results
        in a reduced impact on our eyes and sleep patterns, than traditional screen usage at night (fluxometer, 2016)
        (f.lux, 2016).
    </p>

    <p>The biggest problem with this will be obvious to anyone who already uses f.lux or similar software (such as Apple
        Night Shift – which is awful in comparison): reducing the color temperature of our screens has a very destructive
        effect on the output color frequency spectrum. Once the blues (and greens) are gone, everything looks orange. It is
        difficult to use interfaces which rely on color luminance – especially for contrast, and images just look bad.
        However, there could be an applicable solution coming soon.</p>

<section class="body">
    <h3>Experimental research claims it’s possible to preserve color gamut while reducing harmful blue light.</h3>
    <p>A 2016 study began with this problem and claimed to have found a solution which is the best of both worlds:
        screen color temperature which is not harmful to the eye and completely orange. Rather than simply compressing the
        blue light frequencies as f.lux does, this study was able to convincingly reconstruct images on a computer screen
        through spectral re-synthesis using colors as far outside of the melanopic blue light band as possible.</p>

    <p>Their testing used a proof-of-concept Matlab program to convert 2mb images at about 20 frames per second,
        however, if this technology passes further testing and undergoes significant optimization, it is within reason that
        in the next few years this could be incorporated into to f.lux or a new software to replace it (Shih et al., 2016).</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Use a blue light blocker, if you're planning to work late. Please don't use Apple Night Shift.
